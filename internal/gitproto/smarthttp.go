// to the same-site strip below without git-sync ever noticing the hop
// happened. conn.FollowInfoRefsRedirect is the existing opt-in for this:
// gating on it here (read live, since every caller sets it on the returned
// *HTTPConn after construction) means "follow redirects" stays one setting
// instead of two.
//
// The stdlib already refuses to carry Authorization across a redirect, but its

// it will forward the header from host:443 to host:9999 — a different service,
// potentially a different tenant. sameSite is stricter, and applying it here
// closes the hop that outgoingAuth cannot see: the redirect is followed inside
// a single http.Client.Do, so by then the header is already on the wire.

// from — rather than on the connection's endpoint. A connection's effective
// endpoint moves: setResolvedEndpoint adopts a redirect host, and helper
// credentials are then looked up for that host. Anchoring on the user-typed
// endpoint would strip those credentials on a later hop that never leaves the
// adopted host, breaking the very remedy the withheld-credentials warning
// recommends. Anchoring per request is accurate in both cases, since via[0] is
// whatever requestURL() or the helper-retry target pointed at.

//     only changes based on the actual outcome, never on the probe response
//     alone.
//  4. If the challenge came from a cross-host redirect, rewrite
//     c.EndpointURL's scheme/host to the challenger so the real op skips the

//     Authorization header stripped, turning every push into a fresh 401).
